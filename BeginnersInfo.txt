Guide to the code for beginners. Follow the following stes.

1) Install OpenMpi following the instruction written in OpenMPIInstall.pdf

2) Modify the number of processes of the QCD simulation as to match the number of cores (CPU) on your device
    - run (on linux) "nproc --all" to see how many processors you have on your device
    - go to  openQCD-1.2 > include > global.h
    - make sure that NPROC0 * NPROC1 * NPROC2 * NPROC3 equal the number of processors you have available
    - if that is not the case modify NPROC0, NPROC1, NPROC2, NPROC3

3) Modify the makefile in mesons-master as to match the specifics of your device
    - open mesons-master > Makefile
    - uncomment MPI_HOME and GCC and set them respectively to be the directory in which you have installed openmpi and your C compiler
    - modify CC and put it equal to the path to mpicc on your device (mine was /usr/bin/mpicc)

4) To test that everything works try to compile without reading the gauge configurations
    - go to mesons-master > tm_mesons.c and comment the lines "read_cnfg(cnfg_file);" and "import_cnfg(cnfg_file);"
    - run the makefile

Modifications I had to make to compile:

1) change size of some output buffers in tm_mesons.c
2) comment tm_params_t tm at line 1025 of tm_mesons.c to avoid unused and unitialized variable errors

Extra Notes:

1) NAME_SIZE has to be modified in meson-master > build > include > global.h not in openQCD-1.2 > include > global.h

To execute:

1) go to mesons-master > build and create two directories called "dat" and "log"
2) check that in mesons-master > mesons.in the variables x0 are not bigger than L0 defined in mesons-master > build > include > global.h (or maybe the same file in openqcd) 
3) try to run tm_mesons using the command "mpirun -np 2 tm_mesons -i ../mesons.in " whith 2 substituted by ypur numper of processors
4) if MPI_ABORTS gets invoked you can read where the error comes from by looking inside mesons-master > build > STARTUP_ERROR
